# utarwifi_Autologin_Program
This repository is for a python program that I am working on to automatically login to my university's public WiFi instead of typing my ID and password every time I want to use it.

To use the university's public WiFi, you need to login first and it seems like I need to repeat this process every time I head to campus. The WiFi recognizes me as long as my laptop or my phone is connected to it, but once the connection is gone for maybe an hour or longer, it prompts me to login again, which is annoying, even though it takes less than 10 seconds to do so.

What I want is a program that can do the login dirty work for me every time I boot up my laptop. For my phone, that will be for another project since I have very little to no experience making Android apps.

(other details to be written in future)
